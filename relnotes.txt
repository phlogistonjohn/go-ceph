The maintainers and contributors to go-ceph are pleased to announce the v0.12.0
release. This is another great step towards making it possible to use the power
of the Ceph APIs in the Go language.

With this release go-ceph, via the rbd admin package, can now interact with RBD
asynchronous tasks. These tasks perform actions like flattening or removing an
image in the background. The tasks run within the Ceph cluster (the MGR) rather
than synchronously from the (go-ceph) client. We'd like to extend our thanks to
contribtor Rakshith R. for these changes!

As this is a v0.x release we do not guarantee backwards compatibility with
previous versions of the code. However, we aim not to disrupt existing
consumers of the library and thus make an effort not to immediately implement
breaking changes without very good justification. Please see the "Deprecations
& Removals" section to get a sense of what you can expect to change in the
future and prepare your code ahead of time. You may also want to view
"Deprecations & Removals" of previous releases as they are not repeated here.

Please note that with this release we have started using the `ceph_preview`
build tag to demarcate new APIs that we want tested and tried out but we do not
commit to keeping the API stable. The details of this policy are available in
the API Stability Document [1] and information about the status of deprecated
and preview APIs can be found in the API Status Document [2].
