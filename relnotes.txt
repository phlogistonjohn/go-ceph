The maintainers and contributors to go-ceph are pleased to announce the v0.11.0
release. This is another great step towards making it possible to use the power
of the Ceph APIs in the Go language.

This release sees that addition of new RBD APIs for managing encryption.  The
go-ceph rbd package can now configure LUKS encryption for an image as well as
read & write to an image with LUKS-style encryption. A big thank you to
contributor Effi Ofer for these additions.

We have also added intial support for CephFS mirroring to the cephfs admin
package. Functions have been added that support enabling mirroring, basic
management of site peers, and adding or removing directories to be mirrored.
Please see the docs for the cephfs/admin package for full details.

As this is a v0.x release we do not guarantee backwards compatibility with
previous versions of the code. However, we aim not to disrupt existing
consumers of the library and thus make an effort not to immediately implement
breaking changes without very good justification. Please see the "Deprecations
& Removals" section to get a sense of what you can expect to change in the
future and prepare your code ahead of time. You may also want to view
"Deprecations & Removals" of previous releases as they are not repeated here.

Please note that for future releases we will start using a build tag to
demarcate new APIs that we want tested and tried out but we do not commit to
keeping the API stable yet. The exact details of this policy will be set out
soon and provided in the following go-ceph release.
