The maintainers and contributors to go-ceph are pleased to announce the v0.14.0
release. This is another great step towards making it possible to use the power
of the Ceph APIs in the Go language.

Another round of thanks to contributor Robert Vasek for adding more API calls
to the rados module. Both ReadOp and WriteOp types have been extended with new
function calls, including the ability to assert the rados version preventing
unexpected state changes. See the features list for an expanded list of
the new function calls.

As this is a v0.x release we do not guarantee backwards compatibility with
previous versions of the code. However, we aim not to disrupt existing
consumers of the library and thus make an effort not to immediately implement
breaking changes without very good justification. Please see the "Deprecations
& Removals" section to get a sense of what you can expect to change in the
future and prepare your code ahead of time. You may also want to view
"Deprecations & Removals" of previous releases as they are not repeated here.
