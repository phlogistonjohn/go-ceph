The maintainers and contributors to go-ceph are pleased to announce the v0.13.0
release. This is another great step towards making it possible to use the power
of the Ceph APIs in the Go language.

Big thanks to contributor Robert Vasek for providing a new function to the
WriteOp type. The CmpExt function supports comparing a byte sequence against
one within a rados object allowing one to add an assertion of matching content
as part of a single write operation.

As this is a v0.x release we do not guarantee backwards compatibility with
previous versions of the code. However, we aim not to disrupt existing
consumers of the library and thus make an effort not to immediately implement
breaking changes without very good justification. Please see the "Deprecations
& Removals" section to get a sense of what you can expect to change in the
future and prepare your code ahead of time. You may also want to view
"Deprecations & Removals" of previous releases as they are not repeated here.
